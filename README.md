## Percentage Bar Chart
Render a horizontal percentage-based bar chart that displays multiple bars side-by-side in a single row, based on the sizes given in an array. The bar chart will be re-rendered as the values in the input updates.

### Example
Limitations
- Floating point values are allowed.
- The array will not exceed 50 values.
- If the input is invalid, do not render any bars.
- Do not use any other 3rd party libraries except JQuery.
